I am an economist and PhD Candidate in Economics at UCLA. In my academic work, I use administrative data sets and tools from industrial organization and applied microeconomics to study regulated markets and regulatory design. 

My work links academic research with policy. My solo-authored work on minimum nurse-to-patient ratio regulation has been published in the _Journal of Health Economics_ and follow-up work aims to study the interaction between regulation, the production and supply-side decisions of hospitals, and hospital quality. 

Prior to the PhD, I received my MPA in Public and Economic Policy from the London School of Economics and I worked for several years on empirical projects in antitrust consulting and for the World Bank. _**I am on the 2024-2025 job market and I am available for interviews. Please don't hesitate to contact me by email below.**_
