I am an economist and PhD Candidate in Economics at UCLA. In my academic work, I use administrative data sets and tools from industrial organization and applied microeconomics to study regulated markets, regulatory design, and competition. 

Several of my projects focus on hospitals: developing a better understanding of how hospitals produce healthcare and using this knowledge of the production process to inform the design of regulation aimed at low performers. 

My work links academic research with policy. I received my MPA in Public and Economic Policy from the London School of Economics and I have professional experience as a competition economist and as an empirical economist for the World Bank.
